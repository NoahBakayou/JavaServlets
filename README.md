# Project Description:

This Java project, located in the edu.grossmont package, defines a simple servlet named TestServlet. The servlet handles HTTP GET requests and retrieves query string parameters from the user's request. Specifically, it retrieves and prints the values of the "username" and "password" parameters, if provided, to the response.

This servlet is intended for use in a project (noted as "project 2") and is designed to demonstrate the basic functionality of processing HTTP GET requests and extracting query string parameters.
