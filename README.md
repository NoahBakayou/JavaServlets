## Project Description:

- This Java project, located in the edu.grossmont package, defines a simple servlet named TestServlet. The servlet handles HTTP GET requests and retrieves query string parameters from the user's request. Specifically, it retrieves and prints the values of the "username" and "password" parameters, if provided, to the response.

- This servlet is intended for use in a project (noted as "project 2") and is designed to demonstrate the basic functionality of processing HTTP GET requests and extracting query string parameters.

- Project utilities Apache Tomcat path: X:\Tomcat\webapps\Project2\WEB-INF\lib
  
## Project Summary
In summary, "ServletsTest" provides a hands-on demonstration of servlet functionality in Java, showcasing the ability to handle HTTP GET requests and extract query string parameters. This project offers valuable insights into web application development with Apache Tomcat and serves as a fundamental building block for more complex web projects.
